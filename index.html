    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>

    <div class="Orderedlist">
        <ol>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
            <li><span class="li">Css is not neccesary</span> <span> CSS saves a lot of work.</span>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <li><u>External stlesheets are stored in CSS files.</u></u></ol>
        </ol> 
    </div>


    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However.<span> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also <br>
    special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>

    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

    <p>There is wide range of selectors available.  Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
